# ClarityWorkshop

The backend server that powers the Clarity Workshop, the hub for sharing levels.

### Deploying

[![Run on Repl.it](https://replit.com/badge/github/discountdevs/ClarityWorkshop)](https://repl.it/github/discountdevs/ClarityWorkshop)

This is designed to run on `replit.com`. It uses the replit-specific `replit.db` module. If you end up hosting your own workshop, then it's a simple task to change the workshop endpoint in your user settings on whatever Clarity client you're using. Keep in mind that if you make modifications to the server that change the interface to the client you're going to need to modify the client. If you find any security vulnerabilities or want to improve the workshop, open a PR.
